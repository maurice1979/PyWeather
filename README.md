# PyWeather has moved to GitLab
As a result of the Microsoft acquisiton of GitHub, PyWeather has moved to GitLab. Please visit PyWeather at https://gitlab.com/o355/PyWeather!

## Why did you move to GitLab?
I do not want to support GitHub after Microsoft acquired GitHub. I do not support publishing my work on a website owned by an extremely anti-user, pro-proprietary and pro-surveillance company.

## Why are you leaving up your code for PyWeather only?
I would like to leave a mirror of the latest code here, and along with the fact that versions 0.3 - 0.6.3 beta of PyWeather rely on GitHub as the "updater API" endpoint.

The repo will still be archived, but whenever a new release is made the repository will be temporarily unarchived to update the API.


Hasta la vista GitHub! Hope you get ruined by Microsoft, I'll be enjoying GitLab!
