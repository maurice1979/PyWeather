**PyWeather v1.0.0 requires a new library, click. The configupdate script should automatically install this, but you
can (or might need to) install it yourself. The configupdate script will still update your config, even if click can't be installed.**

**PyWeather v1.0.0 requires a new library, certifi. The configupdate script should automatically install this, but you
can (or might need to) install it yourself. The configupdate script will still update your config, even if certifi can't be installed.**

**NEW FEATURES/REMOVALS:**
* Adds the ability to see the weather for airports
* Adding compatibility to favorite locations for airport data
* Adds the ability to change your radar image size on the fly
* The radar GUI has been improved.
* Refactor of the updater - It can now download & extract updates on it's own, a true updater. No more Git issues.
* A complete refactor of configupdate.py, with better printing and new code for futureproofing.
* Default iterations for data is lowered, and now each data type iterations can be lowered
* Improves the UI in the setup file to not have overflowing lines of text.
* Adds an attribution to Meteoalarm for EU-based alerts
* Adding even faster access to different query types (fl:x for favorite locations, cl for current location,ex ap: for airport, ps: for PWS)
* PyWeather will now use secure API endpoints by default.
* The next release portion of the updater can be turned off from the API if there is no prediction.
* PyWeather now relies on the new PyWeather Updater API v2, which is now hosted on GitHub.
* Fixed various issues with exiting historical & yesterday summary weather data.
* Adds the ability to view historical data for PWSes
* The configupdate script can now automatically delete old variables for you!
* PyWeather is now using a different geo IP API after the discontinuation of the older API. (thanks to Benjamin Urquhart for coding this in!)
* PyWeather's main geocoder has switched from Google to ArcGIS after recent pricing changes. Users with paid API keys for Google's geocoder can still use it.
* Adds the ability to skip the custom geocoder key verification at boot.
* The loading spinners for historical data have been improved for further clarity.
* Error handling in the radar GUI has been improved.

**BUG FIXES:**
* Fixed a semi-critical bug where forecast data and almanac data cache times didn't get multiplied by 60 when the config was loaded
* Fixed a semi-critical bug where if PyWeather is launched from out of folder, a critical error occurs
* Fixed a bug where even with appJar installed, Linux platforms need the python3-tk package to run the GUI (adding better catching for the exception)
* Fixed a bug where if current weather fails to refresh, PyWeather decides to display the weather data.
* Fixed a bug where sometimes current conditions cannot get parsed, and as such PyWeather crashes.
* Fixed a bug where the current dew point can be shown as -9999F (-9999C) and this invalid data did not get caught.
* Fixed a bug where the current humidity can be shown as N/A% and this invalid data doesn't get caught.
* Fixed a bug where if extra tools is disabled and the user goes into the input to enable it and enters no, extra tools will appear anyways.
* Fixed a bug where if you had check for updates on boot enabled, and an update was available, the spinner would not stop to display text.
* Fixed a bug where if you had the logger on, PyWeather would crash when entering tide data.
* Fixed a bug where if a 0-byte image was returned as a radar image, the GUI would return an error.
* Fixed a bug where if you selected an invalid date for historical hourly, the loading spinner would not stop spinning.
* Fixed a bug where in yesterday's weather the wind gust can be shown as -999 mph (-1607.4 kph), and this invalid data did not get caught.
* Fixed a bug where some PWSes spit out temperatures with many decimal places for current data, new checks have been added to round this data.
* Fixed a bug where some PWSes spit out temperatures with many decimal places for yesterday's weather data new checks have been added to round this data.
* Fixed a bug where if a tide station name was defined but there was no data, PyWeather would still show data. Checks have been added to prevent this.
* Fixed a bug where current weather data would be invalid, and PyWeather would not catch it.
* Fixed a bug where if you were running a newer version of Python, various logger.warn is depreciated messages would show up.
* Fixed a bug where if you had invalid minimum humidity data in historical weather summary, PyWeather would crash. Checks have been added.
* Fixed a bug where PyWeather would crash upon a bad .json parse from a WU backend error.
* Fixed a bug where Geopy would not be properly detected as being installed after installing it from the setup script.
* Fixed various bugs regarding invalid data for historical weather & yesterday's weather.
* Fixed various bugs with setup script formatting and spacing.
* Fixed a bug where sometimes there would be no percent sign with humidity data for current conditions.
* Fixed a bug where if a user wanted to empty the cache, and selected No, the radar image would go blank, and the Zoom Level would say "Not selected".
* Fixed a bug where in the almanac, the text displaying `(the nearest airport to you)` would not be set to a bright style, and look slightly off.
* Fixed a bug where when validating some PWSes, Wunderground would return no data, and PyWeather would crash. The error is now being caught.
* Fixed various bugs regarding invalid reading of API keys (thanks to Benjamin Urquhart for the fix!)
* Fixed a bug where if favloc5_data failed to load on bootup from the config file, a default variable was not set for it. (thanks to ModoUnreal for the fix!)

**OTHER CHANGES:**
* PyWeather now comes bundled with an API key as you can no longer generate WU API keys.
* PyWeather now has added depreciation notices which can be controlled with the API for the updater & bootup. These are used when the WU API will be depreciated, and as a master toggle when I stop working on PyWeather in the updater.
* The updater checks at bootup of the main script and on the setup script are updated for v2 of the updater API.
* If there is no expected release time for PyWeather's next release, PyWeather can hide the field when the API says the field is "Not available".
* Reworked the mechanisms for showing either "Rain for the hour" or "Snow for the hour" in hourly/10-day hourly.
