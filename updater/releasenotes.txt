* No new features/removals

**BUG FIXES:**
* Fixed a semi-critical bug where you couldn't add the location PyWeather was started with into favorite locations (option 1), unless it was a What3Words query.
* Fixed a bug where the updater would report that the configupdate.py script failed to run, when in reality it did everything it had to.
* Removed debugging code from updater.py.
